Automated Model Selection And Hyperparameter Optimization Using Bayesian Optimization: Enhancing Machine Learning Models
This project focuses on Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) for Machine Learning models in both Regression and Classification tasks, utilizing various optimization techniques to improve model performance. It implements Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Neural Networks (Keras-based MLPs) while leveraging methods like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization (Hyperopt, Skopt), Genetic Algorithms (TPOT, Evolutionary Search), and Hyperband for efficient tuning. The dataset is preprocessed using pandas and sklearn, split into training/testing sets, and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. Visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn help analyze results, making the project useful for automating model selection and optimizing hyperparameters for improved predictive accuracy.
